Grocery Cart Trends
===================

A python application that takes your grocery receipts as an input and analyses that data to give you trends. Also will include a grocery list that gives you a cost estimate.


Ideas
-----
* DB table receipts: receipt id, store id, date
* DB table items: item name, taxable, price per kilogram?
* DB table receipt items: receipt id, item id, price
* Items should have a tax option (most food items are not taxed)
* Location option, ex. city and province (provinces have different sales taxes.)
