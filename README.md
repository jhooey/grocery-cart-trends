Shopping Cart Trends
===================

A python application that takes your receipts as an input and analyses that
 data to give you trends. Also will include a list option that gives you a
  cost estimate.

This project was inspired by a combination of splitwise.com and Mint.com.
 Splitwise.com has a function to itemize a bill and Mint.com has very good
 spending reports section but they both don't address the problem of how much
 I have spent on bananas! Also, where can I buy cheapest bananas? The answer 
 is "I don't know". But when this application is finished I can start tracking 
 every minutia of my spending habits and then I should finally be able to 
 answer these pressing questions.
